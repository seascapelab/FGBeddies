Included in this repository are datasets and scripts generated during the course of this study that were essential to the study's analyses. Their descriptions are below:

1. Gulf of Mexico (GOM) mesoscale eddies, extracted from the GOM Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM, https://www.hycom.org) using sea surface height. (MAT files).

2. Eddy Day output and code, describing the number of mesoscale features interacting with the FGB over time.

3. Santa Claus Boat code, which was used to estimate the number of virtual larval particles entrained within eddy features through time.

Other associated datasets are available upon reasonable request.
